# SMSS_PowerBI_Dashboard_Project
Project with SMSS, SQL, and Power BI
Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), created a database from a cleaned excel dataset, created SQL query to bring data into PowerBI, and then created Dashboard visualization to answer the following business requirements:


*Build a visual data story or dashboard using Power BI to present to the stakeholders answering these questions:
*"Is our Hotel revenue growing by year?"*
*We have two hotel types, so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type

*"Should we increase our parking lot size?"
*We want to understand if there is a trend in guests with personal cars

*"What trends can we see in the data?"
*Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality

This project will include the dataset, SQL, and PowerBI template, and a screenshot of the final dashboard.
